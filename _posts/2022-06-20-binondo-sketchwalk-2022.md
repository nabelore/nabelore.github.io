<p>On June 11, I joined my first urban sketching event this year (and ever!): the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cem3Ie4s8r5/">Binondo Sketchwalk</a>. The doodles below were drawn at various posts along Escolta to Lucky Chinatown Mall.</p>

<p>Between starting point and ending point was a series of roads and buildings. Not many places to perch oneself so I ended up standing in little nooks where I wouldn't be in the way of anyone. Colors and a bit of polish were added once I was in the mall and sitting down.</p>
<p>All-in-all, what a fun experience! It was nice to be in the places I was trying to draw for once (as even this introvert has been feeling stir-crazy from being inside all the time). Trying to figure out how I can do this again with some friends, and maybe some paint.</p>
